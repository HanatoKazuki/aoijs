# Aoi.js V6.6.1 Template
- This github page was a template of Aoi.js V6, and the purpose of the template was to let beginners to use it and able to understand it way easily.
- In each command I've tried my best to explain it how the functions works or some other stuff in detailed.

# Commands Types
- In this github template, there's 2 types of the command, one is the regular "Message Command" and another one was way more advanced "Slash Command / Application Command".
- These 2 types of command is different.
## Message Command
- Message command only able to trigger when the start of your text is match to the default prefix of the bot.
- As for Slash command, it have already say it by the name itself, slash command the prefix starts with "/" and once you have typed the "/" discord itself would display different kind of slash command that the bot have created.
